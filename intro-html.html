    <h2> Hong Kong man jailed for 'seditious' T-shirt</h2>
    <p>
        A Hong Kong man has been sentenced to 14 months in jail after pleading guilty to sedition for wearing a T-shirt
        with a
        protest slogan on it.

        The jail term is the first handed down by the city's court under a new local national security law that was
        passed in
        March.

        The law, also called Article 23, expands on the national security law that was imposed by Beijing in 2020.

        Critics feared the law could further erode civil liberties in the city, while Beijing and Hong Kong defended it,
        saying
        it was necessary for stability.
